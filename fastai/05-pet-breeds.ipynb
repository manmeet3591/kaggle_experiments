The truth is, to make your model really work, and work reliably, there are a lot of details you have to get right, and a lot of details that you have to check. This process requires being able to look inside your neural network as it trains, and as it makes predictions, find possible problems, and know how to fix them.\n\nSo, from here on in the book we are going to do a deep dive into the mechanics of deep learning. What is the architecture of a computer vision model, an NLP model, a tabular model, and so on? How do you create an architecture that matches the needs of your particular domain? How do you get the best possible results from the training process? How do you make things faster? What do you have to change as your datasets change?\n\nWe will start by repeating the same basic applications that we looked at in the first chapter, but we are going to do two things:\n\n- Make them better.\n- Apply them to a wider variety of types of data.\n\nIn order to do these two things, we will have to learn all of the pieces of the deep learning puzzle. This includes different types of layers, regularization methods, optimizers, how to put layers together into architectures, labeling techniques, and much more.

This is one of the charms of computing: it may be that the hammer you reach for every day in fact came from a spaceship.\n\nWhen you are writing a regular expression, the best way to start is just to try it against one example at first.

We also want to minimize the number of distinct augmentation computations we perform. The performance requirement suggests that we should, where possible, compose our augmentation transforms into fewer transforms (to reduce the number of computations and the number of lossy operations) and transform the images into uniform sizes (for more efficient processing on the GPU).\n\nThe challenge is that, if performed after resizing down to the augmented size, various common data augmentation transforms might introduce spurious empty zones, degrade data, or both. For instance, rotating an image by 45 degrees fills corner regions of the new bounds with emptiness, which will not teach the model anything. Many rotation and zooming operations will require interpolating to create pixels. These interpolated pixels are derived from the original image data but are still of lower quality.\n\nTo work around these challenges, presizing adopts two strategies that are shown in <<presizing>>:\n\n1. Resize images to relatively \"large\" dimensions—that is, dimensions significantly larger than the target training dimensions. \n1. Compose all of the common augmentation operations (including a resize to the final target size) into one, and perform the combined operation on the GPU only once at the end of processing, rather than performing the operations individually and interpolating multiple times.\n\nThe first step, the resize, creates images large enough that they have spare margin to allow further augmentation transforms on their inner regions without creating empty zones. This transformation works by resizing to a square, using a large crop size. On the training set, the crop area is chosen randomly, and the size of the crop is selected to cover the entire width or height of the image, whichever is smaller.\n\nIn the second step, the GPU is used for all data augmentation, and all of the potentially destructive operations are done together, with a single interpolation at the end.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img alt=\"Presizing on the training set\" width=\"600\" caption=\"Presizing on the training set\" id=\"presizing\" src=\"images/att_00060.png\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This picture shows the two steps:\n\n1. *Crop full width or height*: This is in `item_tfms`, so it's applied to each individual image before it is copied to the GPU. It's used to ensure all images are the same size. On the training set, the crop area is chosen randomly. On the validation set, the center square of the image is always chosen.\n2. *Random crop and augment*: This is in `batch_tfms`, so it's applied to a batch all at once on the GPU, which means it's fast. On the validation set, only the resize to the final size needed for the model is done here. On the training set, the random crop and any other augmentations are done first.\n\nTo implement this process in fastai you use `Resize` as an item transform with a large size, and `RandomResizedCrop` as a batch transform with a smaller size. `RandomResizedCrop` will be added for you if you include the `min_scale` parameter in your `aug_transforms` function, as was done in the `DataBlock` call in the previous section. Alternatively, you can use `pad` or `squish` instead of `crop` (the default) for the initial `Resize`.\n\n<<interpolations>> shows the difference between an image that has been zoomed, interpolated, rotated, and then interpolated again (which is the approach used by all other deep learning libraries), shown here on the right, and an image that has been zoomed and rotated as one operation and then interpolated just once on the left (the fastai approach), shown here on the left.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#hide_input\n#id interpolations\n#caption A comparison of fastai's data augmentation strategy (left) and the traditional approach (right).\ndblock1 = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock(), CategoryBlock()),\n                   get_y=parent_label,\n                   item_tfms=Resize(460))\n# Place an image in the 'images/grizzly.jpg' subfolder where this notebook is located before running this\ndls1 = dblock1.dataloaders([('../input/fastbook-master-ms/fastbook-master/images/grizzly.jpg')]*100, bs=8)\ndls1.train.get_idxs = lambda: Inf.ones\nx,y = dls1.valid.one_batch()\n_,axs = subplots(1, 2)\n\nx1 = TensorImage(x.clone())\nx1 = x1.affine_coord(sz=224)\nx1 = x1.rotate(draw=30, p=1.)\nx1 = x1.zoom(draw=1.2, p=1.)\nx1 = x1.warp(draw_x=-0.2, draw_y=0.2, p=1.)\n\ntfms = setup_aug_tfms([Rotate(draw=30, p=1, size=224), Zoom(draw=1.2, p=1., size=224),\n                       Warp(draw_x=-0.2, draw_y=0.2, p=1., size=224)])\nx = Pipeline(tfms)(x)\n#x.affine_coord(coord_tfm=coord_tfm, sz=size, mode=mode, pad_mode=pad_mode)\nTensorImage(x[0]).show(ctx=axs[0])\nTensorImage(x1[0]).show(ctx=axs[1]);","metadata":{"hide_input":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-09T04:50:43.2417Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-09T04:50:43.24202Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-09T04:50:43.864388Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-09T04:50:43.241992Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-09T04:50:43.863455Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You can see that the image on the right is less well defined and has reflection padding artifacts in the bottom-left corner; also, the grass at the top left has disappeared entirely.

So, we want to transform our numbers between 0 and 1 to instead be between negative infinity and 0. There is a mathematical function that does exactly this: the *logarithm* (available as `torch.log`).

In 2015 the researcher Leslie Smith came up with a brilliant idea, called the *learning rate finder*. His idea was to start with a very, very small learning rate, something so small that we would never expect it to be too big to handle. We use that for one mini-batch, find what the losses are afterwards, and then increase the learning rate by some percentage (e.g., doubling it each time). Then we do another mini-batch, track the loss, and double the learning rate again. We keep doing this until the loss gets worse, instead of better. This is the point where we know we have gone too far. We then select a learning rate a bit lower than this point. Our advice is to pick either:\n\n- One order of magnitude less than where the minimum loss was achieved (i.e., the minimum divided by 10)\n- The last point where the loss was clearly decreasing \n\nThe learning rate finder computes those points on the curve to help you. Both these rules usually give around the same value.

Furthermore, Leslie Smith, was not part of some exclusive Silicon Valley lab, but was working as a naval researcher.

There is lots of work still to be done that requires just a bit of common sense, creativity, and tenacity.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now that we have a good learning rate to train our model, let's look at how we can fine-tune the weights of a pretrained model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Unfreezing and Transfer Learning","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We discussed briefly in <<chapter_intro>> how transfer learning works. We saw that the basic idea is that a pretrained model, trained potentially on millions of data points (such as ImageNet), is fine-tuned for some other task. But what does this really mean?\n\nWe now know that a convolutional neural network consists of many linear layers with a nonlinear activation function between each pair, followed by one or more final linear layers with an activation function such as softmax at the very end. The final linear layer uses a matrix with enough columns such that the output size is the same as the number of classes in our model (assuming that we are doing classification).\n\nThis final linear layer is unlikely to be of any use for us when we are fine-tuning in a transfer learning setting, because it is specifically designed to classify the categories in the original pretraining dataset. So when we do transfer learning we remove it, throw it away, and replace it with a new linear layer with the correct number of outputs for our desired task (in this case, there would be 37 activations).\n\nThis newly added linear layer will have entirely random weights. Therefore, our model prior to fine-tuning has entirely random outputs. But that does not mean that it is an entirely random model! All of the layers prior to the last one have been carefully trained to be good at image classification tasks in general. As we saw in the images from the [Zeiler and Fergus paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2901.pdf) in <<chapter_intro>> (see <<img_layer1>> through <<img_layer4>>), the first few layers encode very general concepts, such as finding gradients and edges, and later layers encode concepts that are still very useful for us, such as finding eyeballs and fur.\n\nWe want to train a model in such a way that we allow it to remember all of these generally useful ideas from the pretrained model, use them to solve our particular task (classify pet breeds), and only adjust them as required for the specifics of our particular task.\n\nOur challenge when fine-tuning is to replace the random weights in our added linear layers with weights that correctly achieve our desired task (classifying pet breeds) without breaking the carefully pretrained weights and the other layers. There is actually a very simple trick to allow this to happen: tell the optimizer to only update the weights in those randomly added final layers. Don't change the weights in the rest of the neural network at all. This is called *freezing* those pretrained layers.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When we create a model from a pretrained network fastai automatically freezes all of the pretrained layers for us. When we call the `fine_tune` method fastai does two things:\n\n- Trains the randomly added layers for one epoch, with all other layers frozen\n- Unfreezes all of the layers, and trains them all for the number of epochs requested\n\nAlthough this is a reasonable default approach, it is likely that for your particular dataset you may get better results by doing things slightly differently. The `fine_tune` method has a number of parameters you can use to change its behavior, but it might be easiest for you to just call the underlying methods directly if you want to get some custom behavior. Remember that you can see the source code for the method by using the following syntax:\n\n    learn.fine_tune??\n\nSo let's try doing this manually ourselves. First of all we will train the randomly added layers for three epochs, using `fit_one_cycle`. As mentioned in <<chapter_intro>>, `fit_one_cycle` is the suggested way to train models without using `fine_tune`. We'll see why later in the book; in short, what `fit_one_cycle` does is to start training at a low learning rate, gradually increase it for the first section of training, and then gradually decrease it again for the last section of training.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"learn.fine_tune??","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(3, 3e-3)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Then we'll unfreeze the model:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"learn.unfreeze()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"and run `lr_find` again, because having more layers to train, and weights that have already been trained for three epochs, means our previously found learning rate isn't appropriate any more:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"learn.lr_find()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note that the graph is a little different from when we had random weights: we don't have that sharp descent that indicates the model is training.

We would not expect that the best learning rate for those pretrained parameters would be as high as for the randomly added parameters, even after we have tuned those randomly added parameters for a few epochs. Remember, the pretrained weights have been trained for hundreds of epochs, on millions of images.\n\nIn addition, do you remember the images we saw in <<chapter_intro>>, showing what each layer learns? The first layer learns very simple foundations, like edge and gradient detectors; these are likely to be just as useful for nearly any task. The later layers learn much more complex concepts, like \"eye\" and \"sunset,\" which might not be useful in your task at all (maybe you're classifying car models, for instance). So it makes sense to let the later layers fine-tune more quickly than earlier layers.\n\nTherefore, fastai's default approach is to use discriminative learning rates. This was originally developed in the ULMFiT approach to NLP transfer learning that we will introduce in <<chapter_nlp>>. Like many good ideas in deep learning, it is extremely simple: use a lower learning rate for the early layers of the neural network, and a higher learning rate for the later layers (and especially the randomly added layers). The idea is based on insights developed by [Jason Yosinski](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1792), who showed in 2014 that with transfer learning different layers of a neural network should train at different speeds, as seen in <<yosinski>>.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img alt=\"Impact of different layers and training methods on transfer learning (Yosinski)\" width=\"680\" caption=\"Impact of different layers and training methods on transfer learning (courtesy of Jason Yosinski et al.)\" id=\"yosinski\" src=\"images/att_00039.png\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"fastai lets you pass a Python `slice` object anywhere that a learning rate is expected.

Take a look at the table of training results per epoch, and you will often see that the accuracy continues improving, even as the validation loss gets worse. In the end what matters is your accuracy, or more generally your chosen metrics, not the loss. The loss is just the function we've given the computer to help us to optimize.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Another decision you have to make when training the model is for how long to train for.

So your first approach to training should be to simply pick a number of epochs that will train in the amount of time that you are happy to wait for. Then look at the training and validation loss plots, as shown above, and in particular your metrics, and if you see that they are still getting better even in your final epochs, then you know that you have not trained for too long.\n\nOn the other hand, you may well see that the metrics you have chosen are really getting worse at the end of training. Remember, it's not just that we're looking for the validation loss to get worse, but the actual metrics. Your validation loss will first get worse during training because the model gets overconfident, and only later will get worse because it is incorrectly memorizing the data. We only care in practice about the latter issue. Remember, our loss function is just something that we use to allow our optimizer to have something it can differentiate and optimize; it's not actually the thing we care about in practice.\n\nBefore the days of 1cycle training it was very common to save the model at the end of each epoch, and then select whichever model had the best accuracy out of all of the models saved in each epoch. This is known as *early stopping*. However, this is very unlikely to give you the best answer, because those epochs in the middle occur before the learning rate has had a chance to reach the small values, where it can really find the best result. Therefore, if you find that you have overfit, what you should actually do is retrain your model from scratch, and this time select a total number of epochs based on where your previous best results were found.\n\nIf you have the time to train for more epochs, you may want to instead use that time to train more parameters—that is, use a deeper architecture.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Deeper Architectures","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In general, a model with more parameters can model your data more accurately. (There are lots and lots of caveats to this generalization, and it depends on the specifics of the architectures you are using, but it is a reasonable rule of thumb for now.) For most of the architectures that we will be seeing in this book, you can create larger versions of them by simply adding more layers. However, since we want to use pretrained models, we need to make sure that we choose a number of layers that have already been pretrained for us.\n\nThis is why, in practice, architectures tend to come in a small number of variants. For instance, the ResNet architecture that we are using in this chapter comes in variants with 18, 34, 50, 101, and 152 layer, pretrained on ImageNet. A larger (more layers and parameters; sometimes described as the \"capacity\" of a model) version of a ResNet will always be able to give us a better training loss, but it can suffer more from overfitting, because it has more parameters to overfit with.\n\nIn general, a bigger model has the ability to better capture the real underlying relationships in your data, and also to capture and memorize the specific details of your individual images.\n\nHowever, using a deeper model is going to require more GPU RAM, so you may need to lower the size of your batches to avoid an *out-of-memory error*. This happens when you try to fit too much inside your GPU and looks like:\n\n```\nCuda runtime error: out of memory\n```\n\nYou may have to restart your notebook when this happens. The way to solve it is to use a smaller batch size, which means passing smaller groups of images at any given time through your model. You can pass the batch size you want to the call creating your `DataLoaders` with `bs=`.\n\nThe other downside of deeper architectures is that they take quite a bit longer to train. One technique that can speed things up a lot is *mixed-precision training*. This refers to using less-precise numbers (*half-precision floating point*, also called *fp16*) where possible during training. As we are writing these words in early 2020, nearly all current NVIDIA GPUs support a special feature called *tensor cores* that can dramatically speed up neural network training, by 2-3x. They also require a lot less GPU memory. To enable this feature in fastai, just add `to_fp16()` after your `Learner` creation (you also need to import the module).\n\nYou can't really know ahead of time what the best architecture for your particular problem is—you need to try training some.

Using these tools will help you to build more accurate image models, more quickly.\n\nWe also discussed cross-entropy loss. This part of the book is worth spending plenty of time on. You aren't likely to need to actually implement cross-entropy loss from scratch yourself in practice, but it's really important you understand the inputs to and output from that function, because it (or a variant of it, as we'll see in the next chapter) is used in nearly every classification model. So when you want to debug a model, or put a model in production, or improve the accuracy of a model, you're going to need to be able to look at its activations and loss, and understand what's going on, and why. You can't do that properly if you don't understand your loss function.\n\nIf cross-entropy loss hasn't \"clicked\" for you just yet, don't worry—you'll get there! First, go back to the last chapter and make sure you really understand `mnist_loss`. Then work gradually through the cells of the notebook for this chapter, where we step through each piece of cross-entropy loss. Make sure you understand what each calculation is doing, and why. Try creating some small tensors yourself and pass them into the functions, to see what they return.\n\nRemember: the choices made in the implementation of cross-entropy loss are not the only possible choices that could have been made. Just like when we looked at regression we could choose between mean squared error and mean absolute difference (L1). If you have other ideas for possible functions that you think might work, feel free to give them a try in this chapter's notebook! (Fair warning though: you'll probably find that the model will be slower to train, and less accurate. That's because the gradient of cross-entropy loss is proportional to the difference between the activation and the target, so SGD always gets a nicely scaled step for the weights.)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Questionnaire","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1.
