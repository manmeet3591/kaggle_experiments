But how does that happen ? That's the real question. It's induced by the presence of harmful, unwanted substances in air (more precisely, into Earth's atmosphere). Those bad substances are the pollutants and most of the tables in this database focus on those pollutants and give information about their preseance in the air.  \nAlso, note that [global warming and air pollution are two distinct phenomena](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-air-pollution-and-global-warming) but they do have a lot in common, mainly : **NEITHER ONE OF THEM IS A HOAX !!**\n\nBy including BigQuery to its kernels, Kaggle allows its users to explores HUGE databeses / datasets which means endless possibilities and discovers to be made. I've decided to create this notebook for two reasons : The first one is that this subject is highly interesting to everyone I think, at least to me, because I think we should all be concerned about the quality of the air we're breathing and how we are affecting it by our daily activities. The second one is that I couldn't wait to use BigQuery on a Jupyter Notebook and see how it goes because it is indeed very exciting !!\n\nSo I hope that when you're done with this notebook, you'll have learned a thing or two about Air Pollution. \n\nIf you like the kernel, please leave me a comment / upvote, I would highly appreciate it :) !

This complex mixture includes both organic and inorganic particles, such as dust, pollen, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. These particles vary greatly in size, composition, and origin.\n\nSo how are those pollutants produced in our daily lives ? Well as you may have guessed, The main sources of air pollution are the industries, agriculture and traffic (held responsible for one-third of the greenhouse gas emissions). That being said, us consumers are also responsible of polluting the air through some of our activities such as smoking or heating houses ...   \nThere's also the effect of weather (wind, temperature, ultra violet sunlight for the Ozone ...), the interactions of all those things provides the picture above which sums it up nicely actually.\n\n### Air Quality Index \n\nIn severel tables in this databse, you'll find a column 'aqi' which stands for Air Quality Index. Basically the AQI is the measure of how air is polluted, with respect to some pollutant. That means that for a specific hour in a specific place you'll have different AQIs, one for each pollutant.  \nSo one must know what values of AQI mean 'good' and what values mean 'bad', hence the table below.\n\n![](http://www.deq.idaho.gov/media/818444-aqi_496x260.jpg)\n\nI feel like this introduction was important to give some context and explain what air pollution is about so that all that's coming would make sense for the reader.

In other words, since every table contains the information about one single pollutant, the use of JOIN was necessary. However, needing the information about 5 pollutants meant using 4 JOINs and it didn't respect the timeout limit so I needed another way around.    \n**This is where using Python combined to SQL becomes actually cool.** If you're writing such a query in MySQL for example, you won't have many possibilities to 'tweak' it.

Basically, it confirms what these plots are telling : \"Overall, air quality is improving nationally. But there is a problem with pollutants that are very difficult to controle, a good example is ozone (o3)\".\n\nMoving to our second point : For so2 and co, all states have approximately the same average AQI except Alaska which is a bit higher. For PM2.5, the rural states (Vermont and Missisipi) have a better AQI than the urban states. For o3, California comes first by a large margin and the rural states fair better but not with a considerale margin . So overall, **Air Quality seems to be better in the rural states considering Ozone and Particulate Matter**. I expected the Air Quality to be better by a larger margin in rural states actually so this was a little surprise for me.
