What's more, you can present that story in a much nicer way than simply commenting out in a script.\n\nOne of the great advantages of notebooks is that the non-code cells aren't just simply text, they support formatting using markdown, so you can quickly and easily create titles, lists, emphasise words, add function names in a way that looks a bit more like code, create hyperlinks, insert images and lots more.\n\n[Internal links](#intLink)"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"76875c3e-da7a-4dc8-b258-5bb04ecd9d1b","_uuid":"bc473ae78632c6b289cef28a2ab8783607d240a7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Why not just use HTML?\nWell, HTML is great for making web pages, but it can be a bit clunky, it's not particularly nice to read, and maybe it's overkill for formatting our text in a notebook.\n\nIf you are working on web pages, markdown can easily be converted to HTML.
